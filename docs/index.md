# Azure DevOps Migration Tools [![Chocolatey](https://img.shields.io/chocolatey/dt/vsts-sync-migrator.svg)](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migration.svg)](https://github.com/nkdAgility/vsts-sync-migrator/releases) ![Build on VSTS](https://nkdagility.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/1b52ce63-eccc-41c8-88f9-ae6ebeefdc63/94/badge) 

The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the  [documentation](http://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a [Azure DevOps Migration Tools on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/).

**WARNING: This tool is not designed for a novice. This tool was developed to support the senarios below, and the edge cases that have been encountered by the 30+ contributers from around the Azure DevOps community. You should be comfortable with the TFS/Azure DevOps object model, as well as debugging code in Visual Studio.**

_NOTICE: Both paied and community support is avilable through our [recommneded consultants](#support) as well as our contributors and many DevOps consultants around the world._

## What can you do with this tool?

* Migrate Work Items from one Team Project to another Team Project
* *new v8.3* Sync changes after a migration
* Merge many Team Projects into a single Team Project
* Split one Team Project into many Team Projects
* Assistance in changing Process Templates
* Bulk edit of Work Items
* Migration of Test Suits & Test Plans

## Change Log

- v8.10 - Added `LinkMigrationSaveEachAsAdded` to help mitigate `TF26194: unable to change the value of the 'Parent' field` error. Remvoved `UpdateSourceReflectedId`
- v8.9 - Added 'Collapse Revisions' feature to collapse and attache revisions instead of replaying them
- v8.8 - 'SkipToFinalRevisedWorkItemType' feature added to handle scenario when changing Work Item Type
- v8.7 - Support for inline images using a Personal Access Token added to the Source Project
- v8.6 - Support for fixing links from TFVC Changesets to Git Commits using a mapping file generated from a Git-TFS migration.
- v8.5 - Attachment Max size and linking work items to git repos between projects.
- v8.4 - Support for cross-project linking of work items between projects.
- v8.3 - Support for restarting the migration and syncing at the revision level.
- v8.2 - Merge Git commit Fixing into Work Item migration (requires repos to be migrated first, can be rerun)
- v8.0 - Merge of Work Item, Link, & attachent migrators into one.

## What versions of Azure DevOps & TFS do you support?

* Work Item Migration Supports all versions of TFS 2013+ and all versions of Azure DevOps
* Process Template migration only supports XML based Projects

**NOTE: If you are able to migrate your entire Collection to Azure DevOps Services you should use [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/migrate-tfs-vsts/) from Microsoft. If you have a requirement to change Process Template then you will need to do that before you move to Azure DevOps Services.**

## Getting the Tools

There are two ways to get these tools:

* (recommended)[Install from Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/)
* Download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/releases) and unzip

## Overview

These tools are build by naked Agility Limited's DevOps & Agility consultants to do real world migrations on a daily basis. We always work in [Azure Devops Services](http://dev.azure.com) on https://dev.azure.com/nkdagility/migration-tools/ with code in GitHub and publish as a chocolatey package that pulls from GitGub Releases.

### Processors

There are other processors that can be used to migrate, or process, different sorts of data in different ways. Which one is right for you depends on the situation at hand.

Most of these processors need to be run in order. If you try to migrate work items before you have migrated Area and Iterations then ***bang*** you need to go back.

|Processor |Staus |Target |Usage |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[NodeStructuresMigration](./Processors/NodeStructuresMigrationConfig.md) | ready | Area & Iteration | Migrates Area and Iteration Paths |
|[WorkItemMigration](./Processors/WorkItemMigrationConfig.md) | ready | Work Items | Migrates either tip or history of work items with Links & Attachments based on a query with field mappings |
|[TeamMigration](./Processors/TeamMigrationConfig.md) | beta | Teams | Migrates Teams and Team Settings |
|WorkItemRevisionReplayMigration | merged |  Work Items | obsolite - merged into WorkItemMigration |

### Field Maps

By default, when you are moving from source to target the system will map all of the fields that exist in source to the same field in the target. This is the behaviour if the **FieldMaps** section is not present in the configuration file.  

However sometimes you want to move data to another field, or use a regex to parse out just the bits that you want. To help we have built a number of mapping tools that should give you the versatility you need.

* **FieldtoFieldMap** - Just want to map one field to another? This is the one for you.
* **FieldtoFieldMultiMap** - Allows you to create a list of one to one field maps.
* **FieldMergeMap** - Ever wanted to merge two fields? This mapping will let you do just that.
* **FieldBlankMap** - Allows you to set an already populated field to empty
* **FieldtoTagMap** - Want to take a field and convert its value to a tag? Done...
* **FieldValueMap** - Need to map not just the field but also values? This is the default value mapper.
* **FieldValuetoTagMap** - Need to create a Tag based on a field value? Just create a regex match and choose how to populate the target.
* **RegexFieldMap** - I just need that bit of a field... need to send "2016.2" to two fields, one for year and one for release? Done.
* **TreeToTagMap** - Need to clear out those nasty Area tree hierarchies? This creates Tags for each node in the Area Path...

##### Code (TFVC)

There are no good tools for migrating TFVC code. All of them suffer from "time-dilation" as one can't control the dates of the Check-ins. While you can use tools like TaskTop, TFS Integration Tools, or others there is no support. We prefer to recommned that you use Git-TFS and migrate from TFVC to Git with full history and branches. If your resulting repository is too large we recommend creating a full clone of TFVC for posterity, and then create a limited branch clone with limited history for work.

##### Code (Git)

When moving Git repos between Projects and Accounts you are able to maintain full history. However you will need to have all of the links to 

* **FixGitCommitLinks** - (obsolite) [this is now fixed on the fly if git is migrated first) Allows you to fix the migrated Git commit hooks (and thus external links) to point to the new repository in the target project. If the source and target repository names are the same, this will work out of the box. If the target repository has a different name, you can specify that name via the "TargetRepository" property.

##### Build & Releases

When you import a build or release defenition into VSTS you need to fill out some of the data to allow that new definition to be saved. Things like connections and other require fields usually dont have matching GUIDS and need manual intervention. For builds & Releases we recommend that you use the built in Export/Import tools provided in the UI to move then to a new Team Project.

## Why does this exist
The main migration tool for TFS has always been the TFS Integration Tools which is sadly no longer supported. Indeed it only loosely supported versions of TFS after 2010 and had a lot of bugs. It was very difficult to configure and run. This tool hopes to solve some of that by providing support for TFS 2015 and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

It solves:

 * Supports all currenlty supported version of TFS
 * Supports Azure DevOps Services 
 *  Migrates work items from one instace of TFS or Azure DevOps to another
 * Bulk edits fields in place for both TFS and Azure Devops Services
 * Being able to migrate Test Plans an Suits from one Team Project to another
 * Being able to migrate Teams from one Team Project to another
