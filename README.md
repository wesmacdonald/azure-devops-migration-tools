The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. Take a look at the  [documentation](http://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools/) to find out how. This project is published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/) as well as a [Azure DevOps Migration Tools on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsts-sync-migrator/).

**WARNING: This tool is not designed for a novice. This tool was developed to support the scenarios below, and the edge cases that have been encountered by the 30+ contributors from around the Azure DevOps community. You should be comfortable with the TFS/Azure DevOps object model, as well as debugging code in Visual Studio.**
**Both paid and community support is available through our [recommended consultants](http://nkdagility.github.io/azure-devops-migration-tools/#support) as well as our contributors and many DevOps consultants around the world.**

**NOTE: If you are able to migrate your entire Collection to Azure DevOps Services you should use [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/migrate-tfs-vsts/) from Microsoft. If you have a requirement to change Process Template then you will need to do that before you move to Azure DevOps Services.**
